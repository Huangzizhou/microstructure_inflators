Main doubts:

2015:
1 - Section 5: FEM implementation: why piecewise linear integrand? How to
    compute gradient and integrals in the FEM mesh? Are stress and strain linear in each triangle?
2 - Section 6: The optimization problem: why S^H - S better than C^H - S?
3 - Section 7: Material optimization: step 2 of algorithm

2017:
1 - Section 3: How the idea of extending the boundary shape velocity to the volume
    works?
2 - Section 4: Equation (9): difference between eigenvalue problems. Why this
    one is different and cannot be simply solved by flattening?
3 - Appendix B: how to prove eigenvalue derivative (not depend on eigenvectors)
