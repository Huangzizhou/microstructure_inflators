Parametric geometry model:
    Joint spheres, sharp geometry, smoothed geometry, blending hull,
        constrained smoothing. (Pov-ray)

    Demonstrate bulging problem of gradient-based implicit blend
        Compare to Fig 4, 6 of Gradient-based Implicit Blend
            (T junction, A example)

Worst case stress  formulation
    Worst-case stress field (2D, 3D) (show von Mises + max stress? these are very similar)
    Worst-case load         (2D, 3D)

    Difference in largest 2 eigenvalues (2D): demonstrates differentiability of
        max eigenvalue where we care about it.

    Orthotropic microstructure base cell (for ortho homogenization description)

Shape Differentiation
    Parameter shape velocities from signed distance + autodiff framework
        Vectors in 2D, scalar normal velocity in 3D

    Steepest descent shape velocity for elasticity tensor fit objective and
    worst case stress objective.

    Plot of derivative accuracies (for low p and high p Lp norm)
      - Finite difference
      - Traditional boundary integral shape derivative
      - Volume differential w/o boundary velocity interpolation
      - Boundary differential (adjoint interpolation)

Optimized examples
    Orig WCS, optimized WCS (2D, 3D)

    Optimized designs for various p values (stress concentrations for p < 4...)
        Plot max stress of p-optimal design vs p
        Compare these against the derivative accuracy plots

    2D + maybe 3D:
         Plot of WCS reduction over (E, nu) isotropic plane

    Photo of lab test + broken microstructure
    Lab test plots: force/displacement until break

    Table of microstructures along side their optimized counterparts for a
    range of elastic properties

    Interesting topology (from Brad?)

Lp max stress minimization under fixed load (non-periodic) examples:
    Optimized on cantilever
        2D parametric model: spline curve?
    Dome truss
      - Inflated dome-shaped graph structure clipped with ground plane.
      - Downward forces on (fixed) top sphere and Dirichlet constraints on the
        "feet" at the ground. Feet spheres are constrained to stay on a circle
        in the ground plane.
