Contributions:
  - An efficient worst-case local stress analysis for microstructures supporting
    multiple failure criteria
  - A more accurate method to compute shape derivatives for localized (high Lp
    norm) stress objectives
  - A new, signed-distance based approach for modeling organic
    microstructures and computing their shape sensitivities. Enables adaptive
    meshing of curved geometry.
  - A solution to the bulging problem that localizes blending to concave
    regions (not possible with gradient-based blending) in a way that's
    guaranteed to preserve printability.
  - A homogenization procedure exploiting orthotropic symmetry to make 3D
    stress optimization tractable.

      and penalty only on stresses exceeding a given value
    - Motivates this strange objective by discussing the problem of using high
      p in the Lp norm ("convergence oscillation", overflow)--I suspect these
      problems are due to inaccurate gradients! They use the traditional
      formulas that I found inaccurate). Overflow shouldn't happen in double
      precision (unless stress exceeds (10^308)^(1/p) = 10^(308/p)
      (can still choose p very high)
    - Level-set optimization in general:
        Design quantized to grid resolution--no continuous variation.
        X-fem attempts to solve this, but has inaccurate stresses at the
        boundary, which need to be handled and will break adjoint accuracy.
        Accordingly, the papers just use finite finite differencing.
