Main doubts:

Supplement material 2017 (final submitted (not published)):
1 - How to reach equation (10)?
  Look at new published version of supplement material
2 - Meaning of von Mises?
  Extract stress that is normally responsible for breaking objects (shear part).
3 - Principal stresses?
  Eigenvectors of main directions of stress (max, min) and eigenvalues are the min and max values. To understand, look at $\sigma \dot n = \sigma n = T = \lambda n$.
4 - Stress signal meaning (compress/tensile)?
  Stress that generates negative tensile (opposite direction of normal), is compressing material.
5 - Index to exterior product (x)?
  It is like adding new dimension, e.g. $a_i b_j$ corresponds to $a (x) b$.
6 - Confusion of lagrangian and eulerian derivatives in Reynolds Transport Theorem?
  Use new published version of supplement material.
7 - why derivative of strain w.r.t time equals strain of derivative of displacement w.r.t time?
  Since strain corresponds to derivatives (gradient) of displacement w.r.t space only, the operations commute and we can derivate w.r.t time first.
