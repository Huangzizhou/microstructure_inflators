Introduction
  - Goal: print an object that matches a target deformation under a particular load.
    Extra challenge: do this on a single material printer.
    Examples: bird, bar (target-deformed object + force arrows)
    
  - Overview:
        1) Find material properties at each point.
          (Image: young's modulus field for bar)
        2) Find geometry that achieves these material properties.

Material Optimization
  - E_M(Y, nu) = int_domega ||u - u^*||^2 dA
    Y, nu : R^N -> R
  - Discretize material fields Y, nu: constant value per axis-aligned grid cell
  - What we've tried
        Gradient-based - bad convergence
        Local/global type iteration (constrained nonlinear least squares to
        fit stress)
  - Results
        Bar, bird iterates (image flipper)

Homogenization
  - How can we vary the material properties? Vary the microstructure geometry.
    (Image of object filled with two different patterns: circles, stars)
  - When printed with the same material, these objects have different
    homogenized, or "effective" material properties.
    (Image of object filled with two different solid colors)
  - To use nice mathematical tools, restrict ourselves to periodically tiled
    base cells.
    (Image of base cell corresponding to circles object, and cell filled with
     "circle solid color")

  - Recall: material properties (elasticity tensor) tell us how strain maps to
    stress.
  - Can't spatially average the properties!
  - General idea: for all possible average strains of the cell, compute the
    average stress.

  - Computation
        - Impose an average constant strain and compute how the geometry
          actually deforms
          (Image: squashed mictrostructure geometry, const+fluctuation
           strain-deformed geometry)
        - Average the stress tensor
 - By lineararity we only need to solve 6 of these in 3D to get the full
   elasticity tensor: 3 axis-aligned stretches and 3 shears (form a basis for
   strain tensors).

 - Cell problem + homogenized tensor formula

Patterns
 - We choose to explore bar-based patterns because its wide range of
   applications in nature and architecture. (Show molecular models, bone
   structures, and truss-based buildings)
 - Show wire examples
 - We "inflate" the wire to convert it into a triangular mesh for printing and
   simulation. [cite George Hart]
 - To ensure periodicity, we perform extra geometry processing.
 - Each pattern can be parameterized by a few pattern parameters.  E.g.
   translate the vertex locations and thickening.  To preserve the orthotropic
   structure, we choose parameters that preserve the symmetry of the pattern.
 - Printibility
