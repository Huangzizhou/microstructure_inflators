\section{Examples and experiments}
\label{sec:examples}
This section describes the possible examples to include in the paper.
\begin{description}
\item{\bf Visually verifiable examples:}\\
This set of examples are mostly used for validation purposes where the expected
behavior is obvious.  For example, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rectangular bar of isotropic material with Young's modulus varying from one end
        to the other.
    \item Rectangular bar of orthotropic material with material axis rotating
        from one end to the other.
    \item A thin bar of various material properties such that when pinching both
    ends it deform in a zig-zag pattern instead of normal buckling. See Figure
    \ref{fig:zig_zag_bar}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}

material properties.  One can achieve different bending behavior using the
material property specification above.  Top: center kink.  Bottom: Zig-zag
deformation.}
\label{fig:zig_zag_bar}
\end{figure}

\item{\bf Compare with ``Design and Fabrication of Materials with Desired
Deformation Behavior'' \cite{Bickel2010}:}\\
The goal of comparing to \cite{Bickel2010} is to show the resulting
microstructure of our approach can approximate material properties of their
layered design.  For example, we could simulate poking the slipper sol (see
their teaser) twice: once with their sol design, and once with our
microstructure pattern.  Ideally both simulations yield the same displacements
of the poking location.

\item{\bf Compare with shape/topological optimization:}\\
As pointed out in \cite{allaire2002shape} \S 4.1.2, in compliance minimization
setting, the true optimal shape configuration under a given load is given by
microstructures.  Due to the complexity of the microstructures, one often need
to change the problem to get a quasi-optimal solution (resembles truss
networks) that can be manufactured.  Since 3D printing, especially
multi-material printers, is agnostic about complexity, we could produce shapes
with microstrcuture that is stronger than truss networks.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/3pt_bending}\\
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/micro_struct_bridge}\\
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/truss_network_bridge}\\
\caption{Top: 3-point bending setup.  Middle: optimal microstructure.  The gray
region corresponds to microstructures.  Bottom:
quasi-optimal truss network.  Images taken from \cite{allaire1996homogenization}}
\label{fig:3pt_bending}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:3pt_bending}, we could print both the
microstructure bridge and the truss network bridge (note that both versions uses
the same amount of material).  Subject both prints under center load and verify
the microstructure bridge is indeed stronger.  The micromaterial parameter is
part of the output of shape optimization in \cite{allaire1996homogenization}
(TODO: double check with Bob Kohn).

\item{\bf Compare with ``Computational Design of Actuated Deformable
Characters''
\cite{Skouras:2013}:}\\
One of the more practical applications is to print toy characters that can be
deformed into target poses.  In contrast to \cite{Skouras:2013}, our approach
can achieve the same effect with a single material.
(TODO: how to generate desired material tensors.)

\item{\bf Weight differentiator:}\\
This example aims to motivate real life applications of our work.  With
microstructure, one can achieve some cool nonlinear deformation effects. Figure
\ref{fig:weight_differentiator} illustrates the desire material properties for
building a simple ``weight differentiator''.  In particular, when the devise is
subject to small load, the top surface tilts leftward.  When the load is large,
the top surface tilts rightward.  This allow one to partition balls by weight
(e.g. drop a ball on it and the ball would bounce to the either left or right
depending on its weight).

\caption{

with weight above or below a certain threshold.

compressive force, the top surface tilts leftward.  Right: under heavy
compressive force, the top surface tilts rightward.}

\end{description}

Besides the examples above, we would need to carry out physical experiments to
validate the material properties of microstructures.  Here are the proposed
experiments:

\begin{description}
\item{\bf Material properties of the base material:}\\
We need to determine the material properties of our base material.

\item{\bf Validate sequential lamination formula:}\\
Specifically, validate equation 2.64 (p. 127) for rank-1 laminates, 2.67 for
rank-2 and 3 laminates and 2.151 (p. 167) in \cite{allaire2002shape}.  The
experiment would be 3-point bending test of perfectly tiled microstructures.
For microstructure of various refinements, we apply center load on it and record
the corresponding displacements.  Under infinite microstructure refinement, the
extrapolated displacement should be near the output of the formulas.

\item{\bf Validate algorithm described in section \ref{sec:gen_connect}:}\\
For most shapes, we won't be able to tile our pattern perfectly.  Thus an
experiment validation would be necessary to test whichever algorithm we choose to
generate the microstructures.  Again, 3 point bending test described above could
be used.  In this case, the samples should contain microstructure that is not
perfectly tiled (e.g. the bar in Figure \ref{fig:zig_zag_bar}).
