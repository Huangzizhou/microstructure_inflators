- isotropic: material which presents same properties in all directions
- anisotropic: directionally dependent material
- orthotropic: materials with properties that differ along three orthogonal axes of symmetry.
- microstructure design and optimization: producte microstructures or material with a given physical
  property. Also, composition of materials.
- homogenized properties: homogenization is the process of replacing an equation with a highly
  oscilatory coefficient with one with a homogeneous (uniform) coefficient.
- shape optimization: objective is to find the shape which is optimal in that it minimizes a certain
  cost function whule satisfying given constraints. Work on a set of allowable shapes which have
fixed topological properties, such as a fixed number of holes.
- topology optimization: in addition to shape opt., it is concerned with the number of connected
  components and boundaries belonging to the domain.  Optimizes material layout within a given
  design space.
- compliant mechanisms: the idea of designing mechanisms deriving some of their mobility by elastic
  deformation in one or more elements. This means they gain at least some of their mobility from the
  deflection of flexible members.
- poisson's ratio: v, signed ratio of transverse strain to axial strain. v = de_trans / de_axial.
- young's module: measure of stifness of a solid material: E = sigma(e)/e = (F/A_0)/(Delta/L_0)= (F
  L_0)/(A_0 DeltaL), Unit: Pa = N/m^2 (pascal)
- printability:
    - no enclosed voids?
    - respect printability threshold?
    - connected components should be supported.
- flexural rigidity: defined as the force couple required to bend a non-rigid structure in one unit
  of curvature. 
- symmetry orbits
